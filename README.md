## What is a Microarray? 

A microarray is a multiplex lab-on-a-chip. It is a two-dimensional array on a solid substrate (usually a glass slide or silicon thin-film cell) that assays (tests) large amounts of biological material using high-throughput screening miniaturized, multiplexed and parallel processing and detection methods. 

## Application

There are two major applications for microarrays: gene expression analysis and genetic variation analysis. Therefore, it is often used in cancer research to assess transcriptomic and genetic differences of tumors between patients to allow personalized treatment.
